>经典台词


The higher I got, the more amazed I was by the view. 

我爬得越高，眼前的风景便愈发迷人。 

You can't dwell on something that might've been. 

你不能总想着那些可能的但没有发生的事。

Sometimes you have to sacrifice to do the right thing. 

有时我们为了正确的选择 不得不做出牺牲。 

I guess it's something about his eyes.Or maybe his smile. 

我想是因为他那双眼睛吧，还有他的微笑。 

Because of that,one of the two of them will always be unhappy. 

梦想与现实的冲突，总得一个人来承受。 

Somehow the silence seemed to connect us in a way,that words never could. 

有时沉默对我们而言，无声胜有声。 

And I realized Garrett was right about one thing: I had flipped. Completely. 

我意识到加利特一件事是说对了：我心动了。完全心动了。 

sometimes a little discomfort in the beginning can save a whole lot of pain down the road. 

有时起初的隐忍可以避免一路的疼痛。 

And once I could look at it without crying,I saw more than the tree and what being up there meant to me. 

直到有一天看着它，我不再泪眼朦胧，我领悟到了更深层的寓意。 

The way she talked about what it felt like to be up in that tree to be held above the earth, brushed by the wind. 

她说起那种置身树梢的感觉时说就像被高高举起，微风拂面。

I never been embarrassed by where I 've lived before, I also never really thought about money, I knew we weren't rich, but I didn't feel like we were missing anything. 

我从没有因为住在哪里而自卑，也没有太多地想过贫穷，我知道我们不富裕，但我感觉我没有错过任何东西。 

I began to notice how wonderful the breeze smelled.Like sunshine and wild grass.I couldn't stop breathing it infilling my lungs with the sweetest smell I'd ever known. 

我感觉可以嗅到微风的芬芳，就像阳光和野草，我忍不住深呼吸，让肺中充盈着我有生以来最美好的气息。 

A cow by itself is just a cow. A meadow by itself is just grass, flowers. And the sun peeking through the trees is just a beam of light. But you put them all together and it can be magic. 

牛只是一头牛，草地也只有青草和鲜花，而穿过树枝的阳光也仅仅只是一束光，但如果将它们放到一起，就会产生魔一般的魅力。 

Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss.But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare. 

有些人沦为平庸浅薄，金玉其外，而败絮其中。可不经意间，有一天你会遇到一个彩虹般绚丽的人，从此以后，其他人就不过是匆匆浮云。 `斯人若彩虹，遇上方知有`

Some days the sunsets would be purple and pink. And some days they were a blazing orange setting fire to the clouds on the horizon. It was during one of those sunsets that my father's idea of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts moved from my head to my heart. 

有时落日泛起紫红的余晖，有时散发出橘红色的火光燃起天边的晚霞。在这绚烂的日落景象中，我慢慢领悟了父亲所说的整体胜于局部总和的道理。
