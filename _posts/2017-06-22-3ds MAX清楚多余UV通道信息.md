#Channel Info Utility

The Channel Info utility gives game artists and others direct access to objects' channel information that might not otherwise be easily available. All objects in 3ds Max have mapping channels, which hold information pertinent to texture mapping as well as vertex color, illumination, and alpha. Mesh objects also have geometry and vertex-selection channels. The Channel Info utility lets you view an object's channels, give them meaningful names, delete unused channels, and copy information between channels.

* Utilities panel > Utilities rollout > More button > Channel Info > OK 

* Standard menu: Tools menu > Channel Info
* Enhanced menu: Edit menu > Object Properties > Channel Info

The utility's Map Channel Info dialog shows all the channel data for selected objects. It displays the number of channels, the number of vertices per channel, and how much memory the channel uses. It also lets you name channels, as well as clear (or delete), copy, and paste channels. Each of these commands except renaming puts a modifier on the stack to achieve the results.

Note: Channel Info supports mesh, polygon, and patch objects. It does not support NURBS objects.

##Procedures

To use the Channel Info utility:

1、Select an object or objects to use with the utility.

2、Open the utility.The Map Channel Info dialog opens.

3、To create a map channel, click any channel and then click the Add button.The new, empty channel appears at the end of the list.

4、Most channels have three components. For example, a mesh or map channel has X, Y, and Z components, and an alpha channel has R, G, and B components. To expand all three-component channels, click the SubComp button. To collapse all expanded channels, click SubComp again.

5、To copy one channel to another, click the source channel, click Copy, and then click the destination channel and click Paste.In some cases, you might need to expand or collapse the component display (see previous step). For example, when copying a vertex selection (vsel) channel to a map channel, you must paste the vsel channel to a component channel.

6、To minimize a channel's memory footprint, click the channel and then click the Clear button.

This removes most all or of the data from the channel, so first make sure the data is unnecessary or is available elsewhere. If the cleared channel is the last one in the list, it might be deleted from the list.

##Interface

The primary user interface of the Channel Info utility is the Map Channel Info dialog, which you open by clicking the utility's Channel Info button on the command panel. This modeless dialog shows information about all map channels belonging to the current selection, at the object level. If you change the selection, the dialog automatically updates to reflect the selection.

The dialog consists of two parts: a button toolbar at the top, and a tabular display of map channels belonging to each object in the current selection.
